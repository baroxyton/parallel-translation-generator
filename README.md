# Parallel text generator

![Schopenhauer 'Aphorismen' demo](/screenshots/germanDemo.png)

Given a .epub file, you can use this project to generate a parallel translation

## Prequesiteries: 
- Linux environment (native, WSL, ...)
- Bash shell
- .epub file
- Installed commands: pdf2txt, zip/unzip, ebook-convert, python, pandoc, git
- Web browser

## Step 1: preparations
Run the command `git clone https://github.com/baroxyton/parallel-translation-generator` to copy the code to your computer. Next, navigate into it using `cd parallel-translation-generator`. Copy the .epub book into this directory and lastly run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies. 
## Step 2: running it
run `python v2.py` and supervise the process. File paths requested can be provided relative or absolute. Note that you will need to translate a docx generated by the program in https://translate.google.com, so a modern browser with access to the file system is necessary.

## Features
- Generates a parallel translation of an ebook in .epub format.
- Provides a side-by-side comparison of the original text and its translation in a table format.
- Each paragraph is marked with a unique ID, making it easy to match the two versions.

## Limitations

- The tool requires some technical knowledge and may not be user-friendly for beginners.
- The translation quality heavily depends on the machine translation service used, in this case, Google Translate.
- The tool may not work for all .epub files due to their format or encoding. When not working as expected, using the old version may work as it allows more troubleshooting: https://github.com/baroxyton/parallel-translation-generator/tree/fa3436509671ed33a6532ec5872ecaa5cadab3a9
